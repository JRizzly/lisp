  New Manager at Lawn In Order Means More Satisfied Customers
</h1>
<p>
  I would like to introduce myself to our current and potential customers.
  My name is Dylan Alexander. The owner of Lawn In Order, Matt Parks, has
  added me on board as a General Manager for the business. I am a
  22-year-old recent graduate from the University of Texas at Austin. While
  I attended college, I studied Economics, Business, and English. Along the
  way I had jobs and internships involving customer service and sales. I
  also worked with Matt as a mower and tree removal assistant during the
  summer and winter months.

  Over the course of working alongside Matt, we both began to realize what a
  good team we would make together in the lawn and tree service industry.
  With skills and expertise Matt has acquired through nearly a decade of
  experience in the lawn and tree business coupled with my education and
  experience, Lawn In Order can now further excel in its unmatched lawn and
  tree care service to the Corpus Christi area. Most notably, our business
  can now provide a greater level of customer service. With more man power
  and capabilities, we hope to develop a deeper relationship with our
  customers to ensure they receive every bit of service they come to expect
  from a truly professional lawn care company.

  In school, my business professors taught me the importance of finding a
  sustainable competitive advantage over competitors in the market, some
  quality or process others find difficult or impossible to duplicate.
  Examples include Google's unique search engine, Coca Cola's secret
  formula, and De Beers natural monopoly over diamonds. At Lawn In Order,
  through the increased use of technology and development of deeper
  relationships, we plan for our sustainable competitive advantage to stem
  from good ole fashioned, unparalleled customer service. We take pride in
  what we do and what we do revolves around you, our valued customer!
