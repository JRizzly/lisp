  Why should we use mulch?
</h1>

<p>
  Mulching provides inexpensive and highly beneficial nourishment to your
  soil, which in turn means healthy plant and tree life.  Mulching
  enables, conserves, and enhances our earth&rsquo;s precious soil.
</p>
<p>
  Mulches act as an armor shielding protecting your soil from various
  environmental factors. The mulch breaks the force of rain and
  irrigation, which in forth, prevents erosion, soil compaction, and
  crusting. The mulch also shields the soil from direct sunlight, which
  will assist in weed prevention and unwanted germination. This will
  allow for less competition for available nutrients and moisture for
  your plants and trees. The decaying organic contents (in your
  mulch) favors soil microbes that detoxify pesticides after they are
  used. This keeps both the plants and the soil life flourishing and in
  favor of each other.
</p>
<p>
  Mulches should be between 2 and 6 inches thick depending on the mulch
  material (courser mulches applied more thickly). Thicker layers of
  mulch should be placed around trees and shrubs, while thinner layers in
  flower / vegetable beds. The mulch should be maintained to ensure the
  desired layer thickness. When layering mulch around plants, you want
  to cover the entire area of soil that contains roots, avoiding the
  piling directly against the trunk.
