<h1 style="font-size:40px;line-height:60px;">Aerating, Dethatching, Fertilizing, and it's many Benefits!</h1>

<p>
  Over the course of the following paragraphs I will explain to you why these services are essential for a healthy, thick, green lawn, weed free lawn! Especially in our harsh south Texas environment! Lets picture that our long hot summers did not exist and that we never experienced droughts(wouldnt that be nice). If this  were true, these services would still be great for your lawn because of the type of soil that most of us have. Most of us have a very tightly packed clay type soil that can make it difficult for St. Augustine and other types of local grasses to grow in!

  Aerating- Aerating is a process that perforates the soil by repeatedly pulling out roughly two inch long plugs from the soil. A standard yard will have thousands of plugs pulled from the yard over the course of a single aeration. The benefits to aerating your lawn are to loosen up our extremelly hard south texas soil which in turns allow sunlight, water, air, and nutrients to directly reach the roots and lets the grasses root system be able to thrive and spread much easier. A simple way to look at is - Would you rather have your grass try to grow from looseer soil where the roots can be easily allowed to spread and multiple or  have your grass try to grow from soil that is at times seemingly as hard as concrete?

<p>
  Dethatching- Dethatching is the process of pulling up excess dead grass that over time builds up on the top layer of the soil. It can hard to see when there is excess thatch build up but a quick tests with a rake can determine just how thick your thatch build up is. A minimal amount of thatch is acutllay good because over time this organic material is broken down by microbes in the soil and creates a layer of protection for the grass and roots. However this same thatch build can accumulate to quickly to be naturally broken down. This creates a layer of thatch that is to thick which actually harms the lawn by not allowing water, sunlight, and nutrients to be able to reach the grasses root layer. This is when our power rake machine comes in to play.

<p>
  Fertilizing- Unlike Aerating and Dethatching, most of us are aware of the benefits of Fertilizing. It is suggested that your lawn be fertilized up to four times a year(one time for each season). Fertilizer such as turf builder will help to green and thicken up your lawn, winterizer will help to protect against the coming winter season, and a weed and feed type fertilizer will help to control your lawns pesky weed problem.
</p>

<p>
  Lawns may be aerated once to twice a year, dethatched as little as once every 2-3 years depending on thatch build up, and be fertilized up to four times a year. If your lawns thatch problem is taken care of the first time around when you have your lawn aerated, dethatched, and fertilized, you certainly would not need to worry about dethatching again for the rest of the year, or possibly even the next year or two after that as well!

<p>
  P.S. - Always remember to WATER well after performing any service that involves fertilizing so that the chemicals in the fertilizer to not burn the lawn and so the fertilizer may start doing its job properply asap!
