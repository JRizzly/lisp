<h4>Residential and Commercial Year Round Lawn Care</h4>
<p>
  Just because seasons change doesn't mean your lawn care should!

</p>

<h4>Tree and Palm Trimming/Removal with Haul Off</h4>
<p>
  Some price conscious lawn owners may opt to handle their own haul off when getting a similar service from other companies (especially those who don't even offer it!).  Trust me, it's always more work than it seems.
</p>
<p>
  Treat yourself to a break when having <strong>lawn care in Corpus Christi Texas</strong> taken care of - our best prices and affordable rates won't have you second guessing how to handle the haul off - you'll let us take care of it for you!
</p>

<h4>Firewood and Cooking Wood Sales</h4>
<p>
  Great for barbecuing or warming up next to a fire.  Why have one vendor for lawn care and another for your wood sales?  Stick with us for the <strong>best lawn care provider in Corpus Christ, TX</strong> and we can do both!
</p>

<h4>Fertilizing, Aerating and Dethatching Service</h4>
<p>
  All essentials - if you're considering a company who doesn't do all three, make sure to read our blog post about Aerating, Dethatching and Fertilizing and the importance of those 3.  You'll never consider going without again!
</p>

<h4>Stump Grinding</h4>
<p>
  We conclude by discussing the only thing worse than handling haul off yourself - leaving a giant stump in the middle of your lawn!  No one wants to do that, so don't go with an amateur for your tree removal, stick with a crew that does the entire job right the first time!
