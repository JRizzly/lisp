  The Importance of Trimming the Trees on One's Property
</h1>
<p>
  Many people love the trees they have dispersed in their
  landscape. Yet, they dread the maintenance such yard fixtures
  require. Tree trimming calls for more work, more expenses, and more
  time wasted. Though maintaining a stunning scenery can at times be a
  bother and many people do not like to take care of it, Lawn In Order
  has encountered numerous reasons that confirm the importance of
  trimming the trees on one's property:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Dead wood
    <ul>
      <li>
        Not only do dead branches and lifeless twigs cause an eye
        sore, they can also fall from the tree and make a mess of
        one's lawn, making it even more difficult to mow and maintain.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Tree is blocking too much light
  </li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      This is bad for two reasons. First, as is commonly known, a yard
      needs sufficient sunlight to grow healthily.  Second, trees can
      block any natural sunlight from entering one's home. Proper
      thinning out and pruning of trees in a yard reduces such
      inconveniences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li>
    Branches are interfering with your activities and views around
    driveways, doorways, windows, patios, pool and the like

    <ul>
      <li>
        Clearing out branches can make your entire property less
        cluttered and more enjoyable all around. Trees hanging too low over
        a driveway or parking lot tend to get in the way. More importantly,
        by law, trees must not hang too far into streets or other public
        areas.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Weak or diseased branches
    <ul>
      <li>
        Removal of weak or diseased branches must be performed
        properly in order to prevent spreading of these problems and
        to promote a healthy tree.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Aesthetics
    <ul>
      <li>
        Proper thinning out and pruning simply takes a yard from
        unsightly to beautiful. The benefits include coming home to a
        luscious landscape every day and adding value to a home when
        it goes on sale.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety for people, children, cars, sheds, play structures, pets,
    and small trees or shrubs growing underneath
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lawn In Order regards this as the most important reason to
        have trees properly trimmed. Falling branches can cause
        expensive damages to prized possessions or even inflict
        priceless injuries to loved ones.
