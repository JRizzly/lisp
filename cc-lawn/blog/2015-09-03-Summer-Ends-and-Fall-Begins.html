  Summer Ends and Fall Begins
</h1>

<p>
  August 23rd is the official first day of Autumn. Leaves will begin to
  fall and temperatures will start to cool. Here are a few tips to keep
  up with your lawn in the transition:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Rake your lawn regularly to avoid suffocation (of your lawn) by
    dead leaves and branches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a compost pile with your dead leaves/flowers, grass
    clippings, plant-based kitchen waste, barnyard manure (do not use
    manure from carnivores, such as dogs or cats), and a shovelful or
    two of garden soil. You want the mixture to be approximately 3
    parts brown (fall leaves, straw, and dead flowers) to 1 part green
    (grass clippings, plant-based kitchen waste, and manure) and you
    want to keep the pile moist. Every couple of weeks, using a shovel
    or garden fork, turn the pile. Keep adding to your pile until it is
    approximately 3x3x3.  Eventually the pile will be
    completely decomposed and turn to a black crumbly compost. This is
    wonderful for layering onto your fruit/vegetable
    garden, flowerbeds, and lawn!
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep your grass fertilized and watered to help prepare for harsh
    winter days in the future!
  </li>
  <li>
    This is the time to raise the setting on your mower and allow the
    lawn to grow a little taller. This will help keep your grass strong
    and healthy for the cold weather to come.
  </li>
</ul>
