  Why Put Your Yard On A Schedule With Lawn In Order?
</h1>
<p>
  Many customers ask if they can call us each time when they think
  their yard needs to be cut. Though we set out to please our
  clients, we discourage this plan of action for multiple
  reasons. Mowing height and mowing frequency determine how healthy
  your lawn looks. Business between you and your lawn company becomes
  simpler. Last, it allows us to provide a continuity of care which
  increases our familiarity with your yard.

  Not only does a regularly maintained yard simply look better, it is
  healthier. When a yard receives a regular mowing, it can more
  easily absorb water and nutrients that help it grow. This allows
  your yard to develop that turf like appearance that catches the eye
  of any passerby. When a yard possesses this thick, thriving look it
  also cuts off life to those pestering weeds we all hate. Speaking
  of pests, a frequent mow also depresses any unwanted pests in your
  yard, pests that can spread deadly diseases to your pets. Last,
  since we blow your fresh grass clippings back into your yard, these
  nutrient filled leftovers provide a regularly occurring free
  fertilization.

  At Lawn In Order, we know dealing with your yard can be a chore no
  one wants to do. However, that is where we come in, to take care of
  this dreaded chore for you. Another way we reduce your heartache
  begins by eliminating the need to call us every time you want a
  yard cut. When you set up a schedule with Lawn In Order, we rush in
  and out of your yard as quick as possible and we bill you later. No
  need to speak with a lawn care employee every time we cut the
  yard. (Unless you want to, we always appreciate any feedback from
  our customers!)

  Many people say, "Oh, anybody can mow a yard. It takes no skill or
  attention to detail." However, this logic is beyond skewed. At Lawn
  In Order we recognize that every yard is different and some demand
  more attention to detail than others.  After we mow your yard
  several times, we know every nook and cranny so there will never be
  any missed spots, giving your yard that clean fresh look every
  time!
