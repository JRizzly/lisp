  Do Not Underestimate the Importance of Leaf Removal
</h1>
<p>
  Does your yard have a tree that year after year disturbs the growth of your lawn due to falling leaves? You are not the
  only one. Leaf riddled yards can be spotted all around town and make for an unhealthy, unattractive yard.
</p>
<p>
  Not only do leaves directly block the precious sunlight your yard needs during the summer to flourish, but even during
  the winter when growth ceases, leaves covering a yard cause damage in a not so obvious way. Though photosynthesis drives
  growth in any lawn or plant, a lawn still photosynthesizes during the winter when growth does not occur. The plant stores
  the energy from winter photosynthesis for use next year when the growing season comes back around. Pretty cool, right?
</p>
<p>
  Clearing your yard of any substantial amount of leaves is vital to a healthy lawn year round. What's more, the gathered
  leaves can be composted to make a nutrient filled organic matter for gardening, or they can be used as a mulch layer in
  natural areas.
